py-bcrypt auth bypass attack: CVE-2013-1895
===========================================

I discovered and reported this exploit in py-bcrypt 0.2 while building a server
using bcrypt.  It works by targeting a race condition with thread
synchronization. py-bcrypt was vulnerable between July 2010 and March 2013.

The included demo exploit models a vulnerable server, a user, and an attacker.

The upstream fix announcement (released as py-bcrypt 0.3) is here:

I previously blogged about it here:
